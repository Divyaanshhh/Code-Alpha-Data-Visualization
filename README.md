# 🎬 Movie Dataset – Data Visualization Project

This project is part of my Data Analytics internship, where I explored, visualized, and analyzed trends in a curated movie dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from a GitHub CSV file. It contains movie-related data including:
- Title
- Genre
- Category
- Release Year
- Description
- Distribution URL and Cover Photo
